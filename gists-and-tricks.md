## Gists & Tricks

{% include neurobiologists_guide.md %}

### [Chrome Extension Workshop (Self-Directed)](http://caseywatts.com/chromeextensionworkshop)
I've given this ~3-hour workshop quite a few times. It's written to be do-able on your own at home, too! Even for someone with very little javascript experience. It covers:

- using the javascript console
- creating bookmarklets
- creating a chrome extension

### [Browsersync](http://caseywatts.com/browsersync)
A simple local HTTP server that auto-reloads AND makes it available on mobile. A critical tool for html/css design work. The gist also has instructions for a more advanced setup with `sass` compiling using `foreman`.

### [Bash/zsh Autocomplete](http://caseywatts.com/bashautocomplete)
The BEST thing I've ever done to my bash/zsh.

### [Dotfiles](http://caseywatts.com/dotfiles)
Everyone has their own dotfiles. My way is simple - just a couple of symlinks from a github repo.

### [FlipIt](http://caseywatts.com/flipit)
From the development server, open the current page on the production - and vice versa. Useful for comparing css or functionality changes quickly.

### [Slack Emoticon Extraction](http://caseywatts.com/slackemoticons)
One of your Slacks has a ton of emoticons that your others don't? Download them all at once with this tool âœ¨

### [Push To Talk in a Google Hangout (Meet)](http://caseywatts.com/ptt)
Hold spacebar to talk; otherwise you're muted.

### [Darken PDFs](http://caseywatts.com/darken)
A pdf that's been copied & scanned too many times ends up with illegible grey ink. Make grays black again!

### [Slugify](http://caseywatts.com/slugify)
For a given pivotal card that's open, create an appropriate github branch name for it - including the `id` and `ticket title`.

### [Screen Record Hangouts using Quicktime Player + `soundflower`](http://caseywatts.com/quicktime)
OSX can't record both outputs natively. Here's how to capture both `your mic` and `the other person's audio` during a Hangouts call / quicktime screen recording.

### [Mediawiki on Heroku](http://caseywatts.com/mediawikionheroku)
Mediawiki can be challenging to set up. One of the most cost-effective setups you can do uses Heroku and ClearDB.

### [Pixlr Bookmarklet](http://caseywatts.com/pixlr)
Open the current image (opened in a tab) in pixlr express. To easily put a overlay of text over something, etc.

### [Autorefresh Terminal History](https://gist.github.com/caseywatts/a54bea8b93626b99f5ee)
Useful for presentations where you want to show the audience what commands you've typed.

### [Params to Form Input](https://gist.github.com/caseywatts/5952495)
Easily fill out web forms using data from a spreadsheet using this bookmarklet.
