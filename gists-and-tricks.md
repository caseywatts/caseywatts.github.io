### [Browsersync](http://caseywatts.com/browsersync)

A simple local HTTP server that auto-reloads AND makes it available on mobile. A critical tool for html/css design work. The gist also has instructions for a more advanced setup with `sass` compiling using `foreman`.

### [Bash/zsh Autocomplete](http://caseywatts.com/bashautocomplete)

The BEST thing I've ever done to my bash/zsh.

### [Dotfiles](http://caseywatts.com/dotfiles)

Everyone has their own dotfiles. My way is simple - just a couple of symlinks from a github repo.

### [FlipIt](http://caseywatts.com/flipit)

From the development server, open the current page on the production - and vice versa. Useful for comparing css or functionality changes quickly.

OSX can't record both outputs natively. Here's how to capture both `your mic` and `the other person's audio` during a Hangouts call / quicktime screen recording.

### [Make gifs via Quicktime](http://caseywatts.com/quicktimegifs)

Quicktime records `.mp4` files. You can turn that into a gif using `ffmpeg`.

Mediawiki can be challenging to set up. One of the most cost-effective setups you can do uses Heroku and ClearDB.
