title: Be Happy and Effective with Casey
---

## Happy and Effective

Casey’s past teams all became “the happy, effective team” by the time he left them. Employees clamored to be a part of the team, and executive leadership was thrilled with our work.

Your team can become “the happy, effective team” too, through Casey’s leadership coaching and team workshops.

## Cultural Change: Top and Bottom

Cultural change happens most effectively when there is support from the top and bottom, both.

Neither approach alone is not enough to foster healthy cultural norms. If your team is missing support from either direction, the company culture will naturally regress away from healthy norms. Even a team that is "toxic" today can be reformed into a healthy team with support from the top and bottom.

### Top-down

Executives and other leaders set the tone and vision from the top.

This support comes from words and actions, both. Words like establishing "we value X at this company," and actions like promoting and celebrating people who embody those values.

### Bottom-up

Employees really form the culture from the bottom. This happens first in small groups (3-12), and then bubbles up to larger groups (30-60).

## What do people say?

### Executives

> I feel like we have entered a different era and the technology that has been developed will serve as the catalyst for the rest of the agency. So proud of you all and these developments are so meaningful.

-- Andrew Davidson, Chief of the Asylum Division, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services

### Employees

> Casey’s secret has to do with knowing that, deep down, everyone is searching for joy and purpose in their work. When we inhibit others’ productivity, we ultimately rob ourselves of joy and purpose.

-- Bill Garr, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services

> I dare you to walk away from a conversation with Casey without a smile on your face. It can't be done.

-- Lou Rinaldi, Yale Information Technology Services
