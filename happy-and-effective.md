title: Be Happy and Effective with Casey

## Happy and Effective

Casey’s past teams all became “the happy, effective team” by the time he left them. Employees clamored to be a part of the team, and executive leadership was thrilled with our work.

Your team can become “the happy, effective team” too, through Casey’s leadership coaching and team workshops.

## Cultural Change: Top and Bottom

Cultural change happens most effectively when there is support from the top and bottom, both.

Casey uses these terms because these are the levels at which norms really form, and cultural change can really happen. While broadly speaking "company culture" is its own phenomenon, cultural change really happens at the lower levels.

Both are critical, and neither alone is not enough to foster healthy cultural norms. Without support from the top, or without support from the bottom, culture naturally shifts away from healthy culture.

### Top-down

Executives and other leaders set the tone and vision, from the top.

This comes from words and actions, both. Words like saying "we value X at this company," and actions like promoting and celebrating people who embody those values.

### Bottom-up

Employees really form the culture, from the bottom. This happens first in "small bubbles", and then bubbles up to "large bubbles".

## Happy Former Coworkers

Executives love the work my teams do:

> "I feel like we have entered a different era and the technology that has been developed will serve as the catalyst for the rest of the agency. So proud of you all and these developments are so meaningful."
>
> -- Andrew Davidson, Chief of the Asylum Division, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services

Coworkers love being on my teams:

> “Casey’s secret has to do with knowing that, deep down, everyone is searching for joy and purpose in their work. When we inhibit others’ productivity, we ultimately rob ourselves of joy and purpose.”
>
> -- Bill Garr, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services

> “I dare you to walk away from a conversation with Casey without a smile on your face. It can't be done.”
>
> -- Lou Rinaldi, Yale Information Technology Services
