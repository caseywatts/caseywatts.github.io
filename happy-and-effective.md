## Why Happy and Effective?

### Happy Teams = Effective Businesses

Effective businesses are built from teams that are excited to come into work every day. Research has shown that an increase in employee happiness can generate [up to 30% more sales](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3470734). Companies that invest in employee happiness also enjoy higher productivity and lower turnover. Happiness is a worthwhile investment.

However, happiness may not be what you think. [Happiness is not about persistent positivity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/toxic-positivity-mental-health-covid/2020/08/19/5dff8d16-e0c8-11ea-8181-606e603bb1c4_story.html), which can be detrimental to mental health and inadvertently lead to toxic work environments. Teams that are happy _and_ effective operate with trust, clear communication, and mutual understanding. They address conflict head on. Instead of putting on a face of perfection and invincibility, they practice courageous transparency and vulnerability.

### Teaching Effective Happiness

Casey Watts specializes in helping organizations lead through effective happiness. As the author of the book [Debugging Your Brain](https://www.debuggingyourbrain.com), Casey uses applied cognitive psychology to create training programs that focus on yielding positive, measurable results. This is done through 1:1 coaching sessions, workshops, and embedded team coaching. All coaching and training is virtual (via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, etc).

### Focused, Measurable Results

Effectiveness is achieved through focus. That’s why we start by pinpointing the specific pain points and growth opportunities you want to target. We will set goals that align with your organization’s goals, such as objectives and key results (OKRs). We will track progress by using both quantitative data (metrics) and qualitative data (stories). To monitor the change over time, we start with a baseline, and then measure it every three months: checking in at month 3, month 6, etc.
