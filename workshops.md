## Workshop Format

In a **workshop**, attendees learn to apply and practice concrete skills. If logistics get in the way, many of these can also be done as a **talk**.

Casey’s workshops are usually 50% presentation content by Casey and 50% activities for attendees. Some activities are **solo activities** where attendees answer a prompt on their own, and optionally share their responses with the group. Some activities are **pair activities**, where people discuss a prompt in a Zoom breakout room, and then we all return to the main group and share what the pairs discussed.

Practicing these skills is key. Each workshop has **activities** for attendees to apply these skills within the session. Each workshop also assigns **homework** to do throughout the following week.

## Workshop Goals

Workshops are in three categories: Individual Skill Workshops, Team Skill Workshops, and Team Challenges Workshops.

## Individual Skills Workshops

Individual Skills workshops help individuals choose how they interact with the world and with each other. This set of foundational skills should be taught in all schools and workplaces.

These skills are critical for mental health, preventing and recovering from burnout, and wellbeing. Unfortunately most people only get exposure to these skills by going to therapy — until now.

Casey’s approach leverages both his background in psychology and in software development. He uses metaphors from software development to make these psychology concepts and techniques both clear and actionable.

Workshops include:

- Introspection & Mindfulness
- Techniques for Processing Experiences
- Communicating Understanding & Feeling Understood
- Asking for Support

<!-- ### Introspection & Mindfulness (30 min)

- Attendees will understand the benefits of introspection and mindfulness.
- Attendees will be able to explain a model of the brain as a system using the “Input Process Output” model.
- Attendees will learn a way to become introspective on demand, using “the whoop technique.”
- Pair Activity: Attendees will discuss times when they successfully became introspective, and times when they wish they had been able to.
- Attendees will be able to identify the four types of input to look out for.
- Solo Activity: Attendees will identify inputs from each of the four categories for an experience. -->

## Team Skills Workshops

Team Skills Workshops focus on interactions between team members which help people feel included. Not only will marginalized individuals feel much more like a part of the team, but the team’s work output will also benefit enormously from having everyone’s ideas incorporated.

Inclusive Communication Workshops:

- Psychological Safety: The Secret Ingredient
- Implicit and Explicit Communication
- Persuasion via Mutual Understanding
- Glad We Work Together
- Growth Mindset

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Workshops:

- Why is Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Important?
- Countering Biases
- Bystander to Upstander
- Team Culture & Norm Regulation
- LGBTQ Inclusive Workplace
- Inclusive Terminology & Avoiding Microaggressions
- Inclusive Writing Workshop

## Team Challenges Workshops

Team Challenges Workshops focus on the communication patterns and social norms of smaller teams (4-10) of people who regularly work together, working on specific challenges the team faces today.

Workshops include:

- facilitated organizational change retrospective
- facilitated community of practice
- “Possible Futures” workshop
- “Hopes and Fears” workshop
- "Matrix-Based Prioritization" workshop

Casey has also facilitated many of the workshops listed on the [Product Discovery Methods site](https://pdmethods.com) and the [18F Methods site](https://methods.18f.gov). Casey can help you figure out which of these might best help your team with the particular challenges they have.

<!-- ## Small Bubble, Large Bubble

A "small bubble" is the group of 4-12 people that you work closely with day to day.

A "large bubble" is the 30-60 people that you interact with occasionally, including many people from other "small bubbles."

Casey uses these terms because language about teams varies so widely by organization. One company's 12-person "department" can be another company's 12-person "team." There are cognitive limits to how many people can form a cohesive group (have you heard of [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)?).

## Small Bubble

4-12 people you work with day to day

sometimes called "project teams" or "squads"

Every small team experiences its own unique challenges, and those need unique solutions. Casey will train the team to be self-aware on a team level, and teach ways to improve communication among team members.

Examples include: facilitated organizational change retrospective, facilitated community of practice, a “Possible Futures” workshop, a “Hopes and Fears” workshop, a Matrix-Based Prioritization.

## Large Bubble

Your large bubble is the 30-60 people you work with occasionally, including many people in other small bubbles. At some companies these are called "team" or "department" or "division."

Large Workshops share big ideas to a wide audience (30-60 people). I convey the ideas clearly and concisely, and I make time for attendees to practice the skills in breakout sessions. Large Team Workshops are 2 hours, and alternate between lecture and breakout activities (about 50/50 overall). Examples include: Team Health and Psychological Safety Workshop, Feeling Understood Workshop, Debugging Your Brain Workshop, and Matrix-Based Prioritization for Strong Organizational Alignment Workshop.
