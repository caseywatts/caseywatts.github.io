These are the tools that Casey uses himself.

* Do you buy things from Amazon? Please use these links so Casey gets an **affiliate referral** cut from your purchase. It actually doesn't mater what product you end up buying - you could choose alternatives to each of these, and Casey will still get a cut of the purchase (as long as you clicked one of these links recently).
* Do you avoid Amazon (like Casey)? That's great! Please let him know where else you found these items.

## Preventing Nerve Injury (Numbness, Tingling, Tension)

Numbness and tingling (nerves), and tension (muscles) are no joke! These are what Casey uses / has used to prevent and recover from nerve injury:

* [Wrist Brace](https://amzn.to/3iylnri) - for carpel tunnel (numb thumb, pointer, middle fingers), worn while at the computer or piano
* [Elbow Brace](https://amzn.to/3AkjX9Q) - for cubital tunnel (numb pinky/ring finger), worn while sleeping
* [Pop Socket](https://amzn.to/3AiBu26) - for texting thumb (tight/painful thumb muscles), used while phone-ing

## Home Office

### Ergonomics

* [Monitor on a Stand](https://amzn.to/3dmgXBm) - you don't want your head perpetually looking up or down, it needs to be neutral
* [Standing Desk Foot Stool](https://amzn.to/3dkpjJO) - you need good posture while standing - putting a foot on something helps keep your core/posture engaged
* [Split Keyboard](https://amzn.to/2TfAHj1) - you don't want your wrists bent sideways while typing. Keyboard position can help some, but the split keyboard lets you bring the keyboard to your natural hand position.


## Remote Work

I work from coffee shops all the time! When I'm out of the house I especially have to make sure: I have a healthy setup, I can be heard on calls, I have power, and I can connect to things like screens.

### Ergonomics

* [Folding Laptop Stand](https://amzn.to/3x29m2J) - Looking down to laptop-on-a-table height will hurt you, you need to look up. This gets your laptop screen most of the way up to where it should be, and it's super portable. You'll also need a wireless mouse/keyboard.
* [Apple Wireless Keyboard](https://amzn.to/3mstJC2) - I need this since my laptop is up on the folding stand.
* [Apple Wireless Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2D3AM/A/magic-trackpad) - I need this since my laptop is up on the folding stand.

### Taking Calls

* [Headset with Directional Mic](https://amzn.to/2UQdV1X) - I use these for video calls on my laptop. With these on I can even take calls from medium-noisy coffee shops - people on the other side of the video call don't hear the noise at all!
* [Apple Airpods](https://amzn.to/3oBhjdA) - I especially use these for phone calls so my elbow doesn't have to stay bent (that makes my fingers go numb). For long calls (1h+) I alternate one earbud at a time, because their mic-on battery life is ~1h (mic-off is much longer).

### Power

* [Outlet Splitter](https://amzn.to/3dpCklk) - when you carry an outlet splitter, no need to worry when an outlet is already being used. There's room for you!
* [Battery Pack](https://amzn.to/3uMvMoe) - this battery pack is the size of an xl phone, and charges my MacBook Air more than once. I don't even need outlets most days.

### USB C

* [USB-C Multi-Adapter](https://amzn.to/3BogeK0) - USB-C to HDMI/USB-A/USB-C. I originally bought this adapter for my Switch (it's functionally the same as the Switch dock! same ports). This also works with my Mac, so now I mainly use it for that. It's the same shape/size as the more expensive Apple one. The Apple one is a lot more reliable (less fidgeting to get it to work), but I still use this cheaper one on-the-go.
* [USB-C to USB-A adapter](https://amzn.to/3y0Xeij) - this simple adapter is cheap and reliable.
