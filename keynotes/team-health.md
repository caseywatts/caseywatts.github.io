What makes a team healthy? How can we help our team be the happiest, most effective they can be?

According to psychology research, “psychological safety” is one of the most important factors in making a team successful (see Google’s great summary on team effectiveness). The core concept is not surprising: the team does better work when all team members can comfortably share their unique perspectives. The tricky part is how to achieve this.

How can a team improve its psychological safety? We’ll cover many specific techniques that managers and team members can do to foster psychological safety. We’ll also go through an example of a team health survey that really works - fostering discussion on the top 5 traits of effective teams, instead of just collecting data points.
