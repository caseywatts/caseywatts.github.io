### [Electron Workshop](learnshinythings.com/electron)

- modern javascript (ES2017)
- Node.js, browser Javascript
- the Electron APIs

## Book Me

I'm willing to give these talks for your company or organization.

The "Neurobiologist's Guide to Mind Manipulation" talk can be done as a Lunch & Learn. I'll do a 25 minute presentation, followed by 25 minutes of open questions and/or facilitated discussion time. I charge $750 for this which includes my travel time and cost, time off work, the content and my expertise.

The Electron Workshop and Chrome Extension Workshop are each 3-5 hours. Teams really enjoy these, and pick up many modern javascript skills. I charge $1500 for each of these, which includes my travel time and cost, time off work, the content and my expertise.

If cost is a barrier, we can discuss that.
