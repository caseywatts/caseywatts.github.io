## Talks & Workshops

{% include neurobiologists_guide.md %}

### [Electron Workshop](learnshinythings.com/electron)

I've given this ~3-hour workshop quite a few times. It's approachable even for someone with very little javascript experience. It covers:

- modern javascript (ES2017)
- Node.js, browser Javascript
- the Electron APIs

### [Graphviz Workshop](https://github.com/caseywatts/graphviz-tutorial)

Graphviz is like markdown, for diagrams. It's a tool that can transform text input into a "directed graph" output, which is nodes pointing to other nodes. You can use it for architecture diagrams, DB diagrams, documentation for users, etc.


### [Chrome Extension Workshop](http://caseywatts.com/chromeextensionworkshop)
I've given this ~3-hour workshop quite a few times. It's written to be do-able on your own at home, too! It's approachable even for someone with very little javascript experience. It covers:

- using the javascript console
- creating bookmarklets
- creating a chrome extension

## Book Me

### Developer Psychology
Want your team to be the happiest, most productive team around? Your team would love to see my talk "A Developer's Guide to Mind Manipulation". I'd love to travel to your company and share these modern psychology techniques with your team. So many attendees have told me it was immensely impactful, and the techniques stayed with them even much after the talk.

The "Neurobiologist's Guide to Mind Manipulation" talk can be done as a Lunch & Learn. I'll do a 25 minute presentation, followed by 25 minutes of open questions and/or facilitated discussion time. Each workshop costs $750 (for the DC area).

### Javascript Workshops
The Electron Workshop and Chrome Extension Workshop are each 3-5 hours. Your team will quickly and effectively pick up many modern javascript skills - both ES6 in general, and the specific topic. Each workshop costs $2000 (for the DC area).
