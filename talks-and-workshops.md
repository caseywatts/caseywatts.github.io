{% include buttonlink.html href="/keynotes/debugging-your-brain" text="support employees' mental health<b>Debugging Your Brain</b>" %}
</div>
<div>
{% include buttonlink.html href="/keynotes/team-health" text="foster healthy team culture<b>Team Health Matters</b>" %}
</div>
<!-- <div>
{% include buttonlink.html href="#" text="<b>Practical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</b> empowers team members to be actively supportive of marginalized groups" %}
</div> -->

## Talks/Workshops

Most of Casey's content can be done as either a talk or as a workshop.

A **talk** focuses more on delivering content.

A **workshop** focuses on applying and practicing skills.

## Small Bubble, Large Bubble

A "small bubble" is the group of 4-12 people that you work closely with day to day.

A "large bubble" is the 30-60 people that you interact with occasionally, including many people from other "small bubbles."

Casey uses these terms because language about teams varies so widely by organization. One company's 12-person "department" can be another company's 12-person "team." There are cognitive limits to how many people can form a cohesive group (have you heard of [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)?).

## Small Bubble

4-12 people you work with day to day

sometimes called "project teams" or "squads"

Every small team experiences its own unique challenges, and those need unique solutions. Casey will train the team to be self-aware on a team level, and teach ways to improve communication among team members.

Examples include: facilitated organizational change retrospective, facilitated community of practice, a “Possible Futures” workshop, a “Hopes and Fears” workshop, a Matrix-Based Prioritization.

## Large Bubble

Your large bubble is the 30-60 people you work with occasionally, including many people in other small bubbles. At some companies these are called "team" or "department" or "division."

Large Workshops share big ideas to a wide audience (30-60 people). I convey the ideas clearly and concisely, and I make time for attendees to practice the skills in breakout sessions. Large Team Workshops are 2 hours, and alternate between lecture and breakout activities (about 50/50 overall). Examples include: Team Health and Psychological Safety Workshop, Feeling Understood Workshop, Debugging Your Brain Workshop, and Matrix-Based Prioritization for Strong Organizational Alignment Workshop.

### Feeling Understood Workshop
