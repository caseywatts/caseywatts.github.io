Casey has given a _ton_ of workshops, and very few are listed here so far. If these examples sound interesting, reach out to Casey to hear about more!

## Large Team Workshops

Large Workshops share big ideas to a wide audience (30-60 people). I convey the ideas clearly and concisely, and I make time for attendees to practice the skills in breakout sessions. Large Team Workshops are 2 hours, and alternate between lecture and breakout activities (about 50/50 overall). Examples include: Team Health and Psychological Safety Workshop, Feeling Understood Workshop, Debugging Your Brain Workshop, and Matrix-Based Prioritization for Strong Organizational Alignment Workshop.

## Small Team Workshops

Small Team Workshops focus on the communication patterns and social norms of smaller teams (6-12) of people who regularly work together. Examples include: facilitated organizational change retrospective, facilitated community of practice, a “Possible Futures” workshop, a “Hopes and Fears” workshop, a Matrix-Based Prioritization.</p>

## Examples

### Feeling Understood Workshop

A 90-minute workshop

- Beyond just “active listening,” this workshop covers a framework for how to help people feel understood: **four levels of listening**, and **three levels of explicit validation**. You can use this framework to support others, or to ask for support yourself.
