## More Extensions

Here are some example extensions you might care about (some of Casey's examples, and other ones)

- [Casey's Cloud to Butt](https://github.com/caseywatts/cloudtobutt)
- [Alex Reinking's Amazon => Orbis Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yale-orbis-search/mobledlimodkcjhpmhfeoeeaicnodefo?hl=en)
  - [Source Code Example](http://pastebin.com/VQdV74qp) (it's changed since this first iteration, but this gets the point!)
- [Casey's Chrome Extensions Blog Post](http://caseywatts.github.io/2013/07/23/yale_chrome_extensions/)
- [Service Now Linker](https://github.com/caseywatts/Service-Now-Linker) - finds strings of a certain format, creates a link out of it to the IT Ticket's page (same idea as cloud-to-butt)
- [ITIL Tooltips](https://github.com/caseywatts/ITIL-Dictionary-Tooltips) - This is like cloud-to-butt, but over a dictionary of IT jargon terms (in json). Provides tooltips with the definition when you hover over one of these jargon words.
- [NetID Linker](https://github.com/caseywatts/NetID-Linker) - find-and-replace netids with a link to their phonebook entry. Includes keyboard shorcuts - highlight a netid, press a keyboard shortcut, and then you're on their phonebook entry.
- [Meta-bookmarklet-generator](https://github.com/YaleSTC/ServiceNowBookmarklets) - a bookmarklet that makes bookmarklets. Generated bookmarklets manipulate the UI of Service Now, the IT Ticket Tracking system - calling one of the functions in the software, with our parameters.

Related - another way to extend a browser's functionality is to add a **search engine**! Here are a bunch for Yale:
