tagline: There are so many variables

It’s hard to shop for laptops, there are so many variables.

Have you helped anyone recently, is there anything in particular you’d look out for?

##What To Consider

This this the best article I’ve seen on this topic - they even try to include data when they can.

- Failure Rate By Brand
- Tech Support By Brand
- Watch out for outliers (every brand makes some bad laptops)
- Consider Your Needs
I’d add that you might want to look on deal sites some too, those can help~

##Example Situation

I wrote a long email trying to give advice for a specific situation in June 2012. It’s a little outdated but hopefully still relevant.

>In response to someone looking at a: “HP Pavilion dv6t-6c00 Select Edition Entertainment Notebook”

>STC can’t recommend computers (there are so many variables it’s so difficult to determine what
>the best one is, and as an organization that would be risky) but I can offer suggestions as a
>fellow student ;D

>I think the computer you chose actually looks pretty good. :)
>There are only two cons that I notice with that computer, and you might be okay with them: it’s
>heavy, and it’s from HP.
>1) It’s very heavy for a laptop, at 6lbs. Even if you don’t plan on it now, I bet there’s a good
>chance you’ll take it with you many places and the weight will affect your life. (But of course,
>smaller computers will cost more too so maybe that’s okay.)
>2) Since it’s from HP, customer support may be a bad experience. You’ll probably deal with them
>at some point with the computer. HP also has a bad reputation for giving out faulty parts , but
>that only happens to some of their computer so you might be safe with this one.

>When buying a computer, I look at:

>1) The reviews - which are probably the best indicator of the computer’s reliability. To me,
>reliability is the most important factor in buying a computer. This computer has great reviews!
>
>2) The specs - In my opinion, a good modern computer has 4GB+ RAM and a second-generation “Sandy
>Bridge” processor. Sandy Bridge is usually any processor whose name has four digits instead of
>three. For example 460M indicates a first-generation Intel Core processor, while 2537M indicates
>a second-generation Sandy Bridge Intel Core processor. You can determine how processors compare
>to each other by searching “Intel Core i5 - 2537M benchmark” on google. Yours meets both of
>these criteria! Weight and screen size are also relevant - make sure you understand just how big
>it’s going to be. Other specifics are definitely relevant too, but most computers I’ve looked at
>met my expectations so you’re probably fine.
>
>3) The company - their reputation for good/bad customer service is an important factor, because
>you’re so likely to have to deal with them at least once during the lifetime of the computer. HP
>has a bad reputation for having awful customer support. The process for getting a computer
>problem fixed is more difficult and requires more effort on your part, so you’ll have to be
>prepared to deal with this if/when the time comes. If this concerns you (and it does concern
>me), most other companies have better customer service reputations. For example, many people who
>have dealt with Dell tell very positive stories.
>
>One other piece of advice I can give is to look for deals on a search aggregate site. The one
>you found does seem to be on sale quite a bit. Here are three links I’ve used before:
>http://www.techbargains.com/catsearch.cfm/0_3_0
>http://slickdeals.net/deals/computers/
>http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=32&name=Laptops-Notebooks&Order=RATING
>
>I hope this wasn’t too much - computer shopping is hard. Let me know if you have any questions!
