Sometimes I need to record video of what's on my screen.
1. To demonstrate how to do something in a program.
2. To record the steps I take, accomplishing something difficult (coding).
3. When giving a computer-based presentation, to show people who've missed it.

There's a lot of powerful software that can do this really well, but it's more than I need. My friend Adam recommends ScreenFlow, and it looks really great. But for my simple needs, think I may be content without such fancy software. I've never looked for a free alternative until today, but I've found one!

[Quicktime Player can record screencasts](http://bosker.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/how-to-record-a-screencast-video-for-free-on-mac-os-x-10-7-lion/). System sounds might not go through, but that's okay for a lot of what I do!

`quicktime's raw footage` + `iMovie` = :D
