##Chrome Extensions
All of Casey's extensions: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/casey.s.watts>

###[Service Now Linker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/service-now-linker/jflfhdliofpofkcimfbhgienjmjciiem)
On all webpages, links `INC1234567` to link to the INC, and `KB1234567` to the KB article. These links will work as long as you're already logged into Service Now - otherwise you'll have to click the link twice (once to log in, once to navigate).

###[NetID Linker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yale-netid-linker/ldohdglacgliicighkjcbappdgccbdcn)
On all web pages, finds netids and makes them links to the Yale phonebook. Overall it works great, but there is one known bug: google searching for a netid from the Chrome Omnibar doesn't work - it pastes html link text instead. A workaround is to put a space between the letters and the numbers, such as `sm 66` instead of  `sm66`.

###[STC ITIL Terms Tooltips](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/itil-dictionary-tooltips/mgloibgdcpfmbdbfgihjklicgplpdhdo)
In SN only, dotted-underlines every ITIL term and gives a tooltip definition


###[STC Service Now Tweaks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stc-service-now-tweaks/bfknjdamonbecfmgdmgpbcinbacfnehd)
The [STC SN Tweaks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stc-service-now-tweaks/bfknjdamonbecfmgdmgpbcinbacfnehd) Extension has a huge number of
modifications. If anyone in Yale ITS would like a subset, Casey would like to extract a standard set applicable to many teams. Highlights are:

1. Web links in work notes or additional comments are made active
1. The "Mark as Duplicate" button is hidden
1. In the additional comments history log, hides lines starting with `>` character. Only the most recent email in a thread will appear, shortening the length of the page significantly.
1. In Ticket Table View, tickets are color coded based on last contact.
   Example: A red row means the client wasn't contacted in more than 24 hours, and needs to be contacted ASAP.
1. Change background color for incidents based on Incident State. Example: On Hold is purple, Resolved is green.
