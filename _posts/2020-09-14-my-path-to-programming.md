I love programming! But I used to hate it.

Motivation is key. For me, a major fuel is helping people. Who am I helping, and how?

My path to enjoying programming was winding. Here is how it felt, in order: boring, then hard, then rewarding, then frustrating, then awesome. The high parts were all when I was helping people. The low parts were all when I was not helping people.

## üò¥ Community College Coding
My parents always wanted their children to learn to work with computers. They (correctly!) thought it would be a great career path by the time my brother and I grew up.

They had me do computer programming classes at a community college as soon as I was old enough to, which was as young as 8th grade at the time. The ideas in the classes were kind of neat --- but I did not love programming.

I learned about object oriented programming, inheritance, properties and methods. We modeled buoys and boats. I recorded their latitude and longitude, and gave them methods like `toot()`.

These buoy models did not help anybody. I did not love to code.

## üò£ Neurobiology Lab Coding
In undergrad I thought I might be was interested in computer since or psychology. Freshman year I found a neurobiology lab that took me on as an assistant to work on processing their data.

Unfortunately, labs often do not write easy-to-read code. I spent the majority of my time trying to read and clarify old, messy code. After that semester I left the lab, and focused on the non-coding parts of neurobiology more.

I did not help the lab very much. I did not love to code.

## ü§© Summer Internship Coding
I had a term-time student internship doing laptop repair. We used custom software, the "Shifts" app, which some students wrote to help manage who worked where, when. One summer I had an opportunity to work on improving this application that I used every day in my student job, and I would even get **paid** to learn web development in the process. I was sold!

That summer my main accomplishment was making a datepicker. My boss described an issue he had: often he had to edit the database directly to schedule students' shifts when things changed. He wanted to edit dates in the web browser application instead, which would be safer and easier. He also wanted folks to be able to choose a date where they could not make their shift, to request a shift swap. So that summer I made a datepicker package (as a ruby "gem") for our application and we used it in those two use cases.

I helped my boss, and I helped my student employee peers! I loved coding!

## üò§ Computer Science Course Coding
Surely I'm a developer now. I already knew basic programming from community college and my summer internship. Eventually I signed up for Yale's Introduction to Computer Science course "Data Structures and Algorithms." I thought it would be straightforward. Nope.

This class was notorious. Assignments were long and difficult. In the end it seemed like I would only learn how to manually do things that other programming languages already do well. "How do you sort an array in C? No this is not ruby, there is no `array.sort()`! How do you sort one **manually**?"

This could be interesting in the right context and environment--- but this class was not it for me. I dropped out a few weeks in. This class was not what I wanted.

This class was not helping me help anyone. I did not love to code.

## üòç Managing Student Developers
After graduating, I managed the student developer program that I did the summer internship with. I helped other students learn to code, and learn to love to code. I made sure every feature we worked on and every bug we fixed was well-motivated. I asked the developers "do you know why we are working on this?" and if they could give me a solid answer, we would talk through it. Sometimes by inspecting the why, we decide a different approach, or we may even decide to skip something.

I loved helping students love coding!

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Teaching New Developers
Eventually I even taught programming with the university through the IT department. Each of our lessons and exercises started with a tangible goal, something that could even be useful outside of the class. One exercise I am proud of is having the students make their own [RandomBeyonce.com](http://randombeyonce.com/). They learned how to randomly choose items from an array so they could share Beyonce music videos with their friends. That's applied programming!

I loved helping students learn to love coding!

## üòé Side Projects
I have since worked in software development for a long time. Lately as a Product Manager I do not write as much code myself. Instead, I work on choosing what features the team works on. I still always explaining the why.

When I do code things lately, they are small side projects. I love solving actual problems with a bit of code. Here are a few of my simple, well-motivated side projects:

* [Is My Mic Working](httsp://ismymicworking.com) ‚Äî sometimes I can't tell if my microphone is working, and I just want the computer to tell me. This records a few seconds of mic input, and plays back what it hears. So simple!
* [Folk Tune Transposer](https://folktunetransposer.com) ‚Äî helps musicians like me play folk music in non-C instruments. Piano and flute are in the key of C so you can read directly from the original sheet music. Other instruments like B-flat clarinet and B-flat trumpet you cannot read the original sheet music, you have to adjust all the notes to be playable. Perfect use of code!
* [Lyricsss board game](https://lyricsss.netlify.app) ‚Äî I love this board game idea where you get a word and have to sing a part of a song that has that word in the lyrics. This is literally choosing a random word from a list and displaying it, so simple.
* [Graphviz REPL](http://www.graphvizrepl.com) ‚Äî when working remotely one thing I miss a lot is whiteboards. Online whiteboards are not that great. I would sometimes use the command line tool "graphviz" to create flowcharts using text, but it was hard to collaborate with other people on this. Eventually I pulled together some tools other people created and created this online, realtime-collaborative flowchart tool that I still use today! Although honestly when I am doing these alone I prefer a friendly "competitor" tool: [graphviz.it](http://graphviz.it).

## Other Hobbies
I try and trick myself into being motivated in other contexts in a similar way. It's often about other people for these, too:

* It can be hard to get through an online class. Sometimes I tweet insights I come across. I am sometimes more excited about composing the tweets than the actual class itself, and that is fine by me. I get through the content, and some people can learn vicariously through me too. "I can't wait to tweet this!"
* It can be hard to finish composing music. When I am stuck, I try to think of a friend I could share the demo to. Knowing who I will eventually share it with is very motivating for me. "I can't wait to show them!"
* It can be hard to keep my apartment clean. When I have trouble cleaning, sometimes I schedule a party. I find it very motivating to clean when I know I will have people coming over. "I can't wait to have them over!"
