## Overview

So far you have read about when to use the techniques in this book, how to enter an introspective state (whoop!), how to process experiences by putting them into words, and how to validate those experiences to non-judgmentally accept them as inputs. In this chapter, you will learn how to identify unhelpful thought patterns to turn them into helpful ones. This is also known as "cognitive restructuring".

## Cognitive Restructuring

Cognitive Restructuring is the process of identifying and countering unhelpful thought patterns. Unchecked, these lead to downward spirals of negative emotion. They make you feel worse in an unproductive, unhelpful way. They tend to be irrational or exaggerated. Some examples include: all-or-nothing thinking, over-generalization, and magnification.

These unhelpful thought patterns are also known as "maladaptive thought patterns". Maladaptive means it is unhelpful; it gets in your way. Maladaptive thought patterns are doing a bad job of being adaptive ("mal" = bad, "adaptive" = helpful). Another term for these unhelpful thought patterns is "cognitive distortions", because they give you a distorted view of reality.

### Example Scenario

One evening I was excited to attend a tech meetup. It was raining and I was wet and cold. On my way to the event I stepped in a puddle! I heard several thoughts go off in my head.

* "Ugh! Wet shoes are the worst!".
* “If I’m running late, I shouldn’t even go!”
* “Today sucks.”

These thoughts made me feel worse, and I really considered not going.

## Identifying Cognitive Distortions

Here are some of the most common “maladaptive thought patterns”. Being able to name these patterns are helpful for you to identify them in the first place, it makes it easier for you to think about them and manipulate them in your mind, and it also makes it easier to describe them to other people. The groups they are in aren't strict, just helpful to make these more memorable.

### Feelings vs Facts

* **Emotional Reasoning** is when you believe something based on a feeling, as opposed to thinking about it and basing it on facts.

### Generalizing: Needs nuance

* **Overgeneralization** is applying a small amount of information to explain a whole situation, inaccurately. Not incorporating enough nuance.
* **Labeling** is a subset of overgeneralization. This could be labeling someone or something and using that to make inaccurate predictions.
* **All or nothing thinking** is when you think in a binary yes/no or good/bad kind of way. Truth often lies in a gray area between the two extremes.

### Focusing: Positive versus negative

* **Magnification** is focusing too much on something (often negative), and **minimization** is focusing too little on something (often positive).
* **Disqualifying the positive** is when you acknowledge something positive, but convince yourself that it doesn't count.

### People

* **Personalization** is believing you have more control or influence over a situation than you actually do, often by not taking into account external forces.
* **Mind reading** is believing you know what another person is thinking or feeling without any evidence, often negative.

### Outcome Prediction

* **Fortune-telling** is believing you know how something will turn out, usually for the worse.
* **Catastrophization** is focusing on the worst possible outcome of a situation, especially when it is a less likely outcome.

### Scenario Continued

I gave myself a "whoop!" which made me smile a little despite my mood. I took a moment to take stock of the automatic thoughts I just experienced, and the automatic feelings I was having.

I identified what cognitive distortions these were by name

EXAMPLES

...and then I thought of more adaptive and realistic alternative thoughts. I ended up going to the event after all, and I was very glad I did.

### Example Continued

We’ll go through each one and discuss what makes them maladaptive, label them, and consider an alternative “deliberate thought” to think to ourselves instead.

WET SHOES ARE THE WORST -> MAGNIFICATION

I would label “wet shoes are the worst” as "magnification" or “catastrophization”. It’s blowing it out of proportion - not only are they bad, but they’re the WORST. I could adjust this to be more accurate and rational by thinking something more adaptive, like "Wet shoes are not literally the worst, obviously. I am feeling really uncomfortable and cold right now, and these wet shoes are making it worse. It's really unfortunate this happened.". This may not be as satisfying to exclaim as “wet shoes are the worst!”, but that's the point - this diffuses you, and prevents you from experiencing a downward spiral of more, even more negative automatic thoughts and emotions.

IF I AM LATE I SOHULD NOT GO -> ALL OR NOTHING

I might automatically think "If I'm running late, I just shouldn't go!". If I catch myself, I might label this as "all or nothing thinking" (black and white thinking). I could defuse this with something like "The gray area answer is often pretty good, lemme think about it more. Is it really that bad to be late? Will it make you look so bad that it's literally not worth attending? No! Hmm I thought going was worth it before, and it's probably still pretty worthwhile. Actually yeah, the topic is great and the people are great and..."

TODAY SUCKS -> OVERGENERALIZING, DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE, JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS

I might automatically think "Today sucks!". Hoo boy, this has several maladaptive thought patterns! "Overgeneralizing" the entire day, "disqualifying the positive" things that happened earlier in the day, and "fortune telling" that the rest of the day is also going to be bad. Dwelling on this isn't going to be helpful (rumination!) - we want to defuse the feeling now that we're aware of it.

## Countering Cognitive Distortions

Once you have identified the maladaptive thought pattern, you can start brainstorming ways to make it more adaptive. You can consider how to make it more accurate, true, or rational.

You might like the “two column” technique. The left column is for the “automatic thought” and the right column is for any “deliberate thoughts” you can think of to counter that maladaptive automatic thought. You can also note the specific maladaptive thought pattern by name to help you focus on the problematic parts of it.

Start by writing down the unhelpful thoughts on the left column. If you can name any, you can add what maladaptive thought pattern it is. Once you have identified these unhelpful thoughts, you can brainstorm more helpful thoughts in the right column.

TWO COLUMN TECHNIQUE EXAMPLE

Knowing these
This also prompts you to replace it with a more helpful "adaptive thought" instead.

## Debugging Metaphor

This is a sidebar. If you have worked with refactoring code smells in the past, this metaphor may help with the next sections. If not, you can skip this part and the rest should read clearly enough.

Cognitive Restructuring is like "refactoring" in software development. With refactoring, often you first identify a "code smell", and then you refactor to make that smell go away. An example is

EXAMPLE
An example is a function that’s too long, or a variable with a name that doesn’t tell you what it is.

A “code smell” is something you notice about a piece of code that suggests there may be an issue with it. You might not be able to identify or name what exactly "smells" about the code right away, sometimes you just have a sense something is off. With practice, you can get good at identifying and naming the issues with standard code smell names.

To fix a code smell, you can often use a particular “refactoring technique”. This might be breaking a long function down into several smaller functions, or renaming a variable name to be more descriptive.

NAMED CODE SMELLS AND REFACTORING TECHNIQUES
If you can name the code smell, that's even more helpful because you can talk about it with other folks and google it. You can give more concrete feedback during code review. Naming it is powerful, because it can help you counter it as well.

To read more about these named code smells and refactoring techniques, you might like the book [“Refactoring”](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) by Martin Fowler, or the website [Sourcemaking](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring).

### Review

Two debugging steps from earlier chapters:

1. When you feel yourself potentially downward spiraling, get into a mindful state. Whoop!
2. In a mindful state, listen to and describe your inputs: your automatic thoughts and feelings.

In this chapter we will cover two more steps:

1. Identfy any thoughts that are unrealistic or unproductive, and name them.
2. For each unhelpful thought, think of an alternative thought that is more  realistic and helpful.

### Another Review

In the previous chapters, you learned how to CHAPTER1 then CHAPTER2 then CHAPTER3

Processing overview. You've covered 1 and 2 in the previous chapters, and we'll do 3 and 4 in this one.

1. Notice an opportunity to introspect. Whoop!
2. Describe your automatic thoughts and feelings.
3. Identify which thoughts are unhelpful.
4. Respond to the unhelpful thoughts with more helpful ones.


## Automatic vs Deliberate Recap

ISNT THIS EARLIER? MAYBE MERGE IT IN EARLIER

An “automatic thought” is different from a “deliberate thought”. In our model of the mind from earlier in the book, an “automatic thought” is an input to your conscious mind, and a “deliberate thought” is from your conscious mind. You choose your deliberate thoughts, but you don't choose your automatic thoughts.

A similar dichotomy applies to feelings as well. Automatic feelings happen to you, and those are out of your control. Other feelings you can influence through your deliberate thoughts. Although you cannot directly control emotions through willpower alone, you can however influence those feelings through your thoughts.

|  | automatic | deliberate |
| thought | automatic thought | deliberate thought |
| feeling | automatic feeling | influenced feeling |

## When to let it through

There is some utility in declaring your unhappy state to others (and to yourself?) - conveying your current emotional state. It might be cathartic to express it, especially if there's nothing that can be done about it.

The goal here is not to ruminate. Let's look at the definition of rumination:
> Dwelling on the causes and consequences as opposed to the solutions

I could remind myself to angriness will go away when I eat, or that when I get there I can I can take my shoes off and dry my socks off. I'll feel awesome once my feet are dry. I'm literally soaked, everybody would understand. I probably wouldn't be the only one so wet!

This chapter covers the number one most useful thing I learned in “Intro to Psychology” - how to diffuse rumination by identifying and countering these maladaptive thought patterns.

## More Resources

### Maladaptive Thought Patterns

I imagine you’re interested in learning a lot more about maladaptive thought patterns than I’ve described here, and that’s wonderful! First I recommend reading the Wikipedia page on [“Cognitive distortion”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion)

### CBT Personal Trainer = Therapist

I think of CBT as Training more than Therapy. Therapists happen to be the best/only trainers of CBT.

The most effective option is definitely to see an actual therapist. Hopefully this is covered under your health insurance. The most common diagnosis that might get you in to see a CBT therapist is Social Anxiety Disorder.

Most people have an amount of Social Anxiety. People are only diagnosed with the disorder if it affects your life in a significant and negative way. It's possible you're "eligible" - have a healthcare provider screen you if you think this is possible and/or interesting. There are so so many undiagnosed mental illnesses in the US because of the stigma around mental health. You can think of it as training :)

### CBT Book

There's one particular book which is prescribed often by therapists to their patients as homework. You can buy this book without a prescription. A lot of my friends have read this book, and they rave about it. It has changed lives.

There are some studies that suggest getting therapy through this book is as effective as seeing a therapist (for many people, but not everyone). (Disclaimer: I read that in the book haha - but it does seem legitimate!). It seems to be more likely to succeed the more motivated you are. In the case of the studies, the worse your depression is - I'd like to interpret that to mean, the more motivated you are to improve, the more likely the book route is to succeed.

### Meditation App

I described this in more detail above; I'm including it here as another resource:

Headspace

### Joyable

Joyable is a webapp that helps with Social Anxiety, using CBT. It is great about checking in with you to make sure you actually do your "homework" and practice the CBT techniques.

It's great for social anxiety. I haven't yet found an app that helps with CBT more generally - I hope someone makes one!

Joyable

### Practice / training

Well, that's all almost true ^. What's really true is that you're aware of the existence of these tools you can use, and it's up to you to practice these.

You might pick one maladaptive thought pattern per week to look out for and work on.

Check in with yourself about these ideas regularly.

One tip I have is to make a weekly 15-minute calendar event (or something like that). Maybe attach it to something else you do reliably, so they trigger each other to happen? Habit forming could be its own entire post/chapter.
Make some small, achievable goals, and track them?

## Why doesn't everybody already do CBT

CBT takes time, energy, and skill.

Most people aren't aware this is a skill you can work on. Many people who are aware probably aren't sure how to develop it. You do, now :)

You'll be able to work on this gradually, but the rate at which you can work on this is limited. But you don't have infinite time or energy. Try and celebrate the rate of progress - celebrate tiny steps in the right direction. It's a long journey.

## Summary

Now you know how to get into the Whoop State. Once you're in there, you know what types of inputs to your system to think about. You know how to process your emotions better, and you can identify maladaptive thought patterns, replacing them with more adaptive ones.

With all these put together, you can choose as a response that's more effective than what you might have done otherwise. You'll be more productive and happier. Any time you're about to hit a downward spiral, you can stop yourself and take control of your mind.

You are now a Mind Manipulator, of your own mind! You've finally figured out how to use the debugger for your brain. Now you can debug this "software" that's been running nonstop your whole life. You have so much potential, and so much power :)
