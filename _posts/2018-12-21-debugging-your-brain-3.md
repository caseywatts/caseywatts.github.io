# Processing Emotion
To get better at processing your emotions, I have six concrete techniques for you!

* Expand your emotional vocabulary
* Talk with a friend
* Rubber Duck
* Journaling
* Reading Fiction
* Meditation

In the section after this one, we’ll cover how to influence your emotions using your thoughts.

### Emotions as Inputs
Before we jump into these six, I’ll explain a principle that applies to each of these: accepting “emotions as inputs”.

In the moment where you experience an emotion, it’s already outside of your control and influence. In the system we described earlier (input, process, output), “you” are your conscious mind, and these “automatic emotions” are an input to your system. It helps to accept automatic emotions as data for your mind to process. This takes a lot of practice and training. Many meditation practices focus on this skill - observing thoughts and emotions non-judgmentally.

If you can accept automatic emotions as inputs to your system, you will better be able to [xyz].

Processing emotions helps you choose the best response for a situation. You can also influence your future feelings through the thoughts you choose to think.
Six Emotion Processing Techniques


## Talk with a friend

My top favorite way to process emotions (and thoughts) is by talking through them with a close friend. You could both feel better, and understand yourself better. Friends can validate your experiences by reflecting back to you what they think you’re thinking/feeling. If you end up with a shared understanding of your experience, that can be very comforting. They can summarize with different words and phrasing than you have, which can also improve how you understand yourself.

### Close Relationships
Hopefully you have several close friends you can readily talk to about your thoughts and feelings. Studies show that the more close connections you have, the healthier you are, the longer you live, and the more resilient you are in the face of stress. The list of positive benefits of social connectedness goes on and on.

There is a recent “loneliness epidemic” in the US. [source](https://www.cigna.com/newsroom/news-releases/2018/new-cigna-study-reveals-loneliness-at-epidemic-levels-in-america). If you don't feel like you have many (or any?) close friends you can have intimate discussions with, you may want to make deepening relationships a priority. This can be really difficult, but it’s well worth the effort.

Ideally your emotionally supportive relationships are reciprocal. You should also offer to talk friends through issues they’re having as well. Assuming this discussion all goes well, being vulnerable like this with each other can dramatically improve your relationship. It can deepen feelings of trust with each other.

### Communicating Validation
If you want others to help emotionally support you by listening, you should work on this yourself, too. My favorite tool for validating others is Dr. Linehan’s “Six Levels of Validation”. Just to give you a teaser, these are her six levels of validation, in order of increasing impact:

1. Be present
2. Accurate reflection
3. Guessing about unstated feelings
4. Validate in terms of past history
5. Validate in terms of present events and the way most people would react
6. Radical genuineness

I recommend reading more about this and trying this out. It’s not a strict scale of what you should use, but it’s a really helpful tool when considering how to respond to a friend who is being vulnerable with you. My favorite high-level overview of this is [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pieces-mind/201204/understanding-validation-way-communicate-acceptance) by Karyn Hall. If you want a more thorough overview right from the source, you might consider reading [this chapter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232561580_Validation_and_psychotherapy) from “Validation and Psychotherapy” by Marsha Linehan, 1997.

### Too Much?

Sharing your emotions with others is often really good for you, and it can bring you closer together. There is an extreme though, which could be a problem. It is possible to impose too much, expecting your friend to do “emotional labor” for you in a way that they could resent. If the support is one-way (they support you more than you support them), that makes it much more likely your friend would feel frustrated. If there’s an imbalance in how much each of you need in the first place, that could be an issue too. Prioritize communicating with your close friends about these concerns to set healthy boundaries.

A friend’s support can go a long way, but for deeper issues or trauma friends may not be enough. Therapists are trained to help with this. Think about whether this support is enough, or if a therapist might help more. If you haven’t tried therapy, you should seriously consider at least being screened.

## Emotional vocabulary

The ability to describe our emotions using words is extremely powerful. It’s much easier to think about these feelings when we have words to describe them. Words give the emotions “handles” that we can use to inspect them and figure out what they really are. This helps both for conveying our emotions to other people. This even helps us work with the emotions inside our own minds.

Expanding your emotional vocabulary can help a lot. Children are usually taught simple emotions first - like happy, sad, angry, tired. Many people continue to rely on a relatively small set of emotion-words even in adulthood. With effort, you can learn to use a much richer vocabulary.

You already distinguish between many types of happy when other people use the words - such as excited, relieved, content, proud, or accomplished. The next step is to start using richer words yourself, too. The more you use these, the more quickly and readily you will be able to use them to describe yourself. The more you practice, the more you’ll start using these naturally.

One way to expand your emotional vocabulary is by keeping a thesaurus-like chart like this around. Print this one out, or save it to your desktop. Refer to it when trying to describe your emotions. There are many more resources like this online - some in circular graphs, some with more colors. You might also try a traditional thesaurus, especially when you have a specific feeling you can’t quite describe.

I often work on expanding my emotional vocabulary a lot while talking with friends. Sometimes I ramble a bit first, trying to figure out the right word, and my friends help. For example, I might try: “I feel good about it. Excited maybe? Not quite excited, but I think it’ll go my way, and that’s comforting” and in response, my friend might suggest “are you feeling confident?”. Often we can find a single word. If not, we can at least find a phrase or sentence-long explanation of the feeling. Once we have a shared understanding, that really validates my experience. This shared understanding helps me feel like the emotion has been processed. I feel relief.

## Rubber duck

The “rubber duck” technique is a common trick among software developers. In the programming context it is called “rubber duck debugging”. Just by explaining the situation to the duck, you may gain insight into the problem. You can imagine the responses and questions a person would have if you were explaining this to them. You can imagine the duck as your coworker, friend, partner, or anyone. The imagined-person might help you realize an assumption you’re making that might be wrong, or they might help you notice something you overlooked before. If the duck doesn’t help enough, you can always fall back to asking a coworker or friend for help.

I often use a written variant of this. I start by draft an email or instant message to a coworker explaining the situation. Before I send it, I make it as thorough as I imagine they’d want. I answer the questions I know they’d ask. Often, I end up not needing to send the email at all! The questions I imagined they would ask me help a lot. Even though I use this technique a lot, I still feel surprised every time just how effective it is.

I’m using work examples here, but the same idea applies to personal experiences you have, too. You can change the imagined-audience to be your best friend or someone else appropriate. If there’s nobody appropriate, you might try making up someone who is magically wise about this situation.

## Journaling

You don't even have to have another person as your audience when talking/writing. Journaling could be writing to yourself, future-you, past-you, or even to the journal itself. Journaling is a really useful tool to have in your emotional toolbelt.

Sometimes I imagine writing to future-Casey or past-Casey. Sometimes I imagine writing a friend, like I mentioned above. I write out all my thoughts and all my emotions in stream of consciousness, putting it all to words. I try to use really specific emotional words so I can really deeply understand it. I also try and identify maladaptive thought patterns, which we’ll cover in the next section.

My biggest tip is to make it easy for yourself to journal. Many people keep a paper journal handy at home. My favorite way is journaling into a gmail draft message. Somehow that loads faster than Google Docs or Microsoft Word, and it also feels more temporary.

Every time I journal I feel surprised how much it helps. You might imagine that thinking to yourself is similar, but somehow writing is a very different experience. When writing, you can pin more things down, and get a lot deeper and farther along with processing.

There is a major risk with journaling, and that’s rumination. Rumination is when you focus on the causes and consequences of something, instead of solutions. If you are too fixated on the negative, it can cause a downward spiral and make you feel even worse. Ideally you will develop techniques to be able to journal more effectively. Accepting inputs as things you cannot change, and identifying maladaptive thought patterns like we’ll do in the next section. You could accidentally reinforce maladaptive thought patterns if you’re not careful, or if you’re not in the right mindset to deal with them. If that’s the case, you may want to try another technique, or try again later.

## Reading fiction

Most people agree that reading nonfiction can be "useful". Nonfiction teaches us facts. People are more divided about how useful fiction is. Fiction may not teach as many facts, but it is often "useful" for social and emotional learning!

Fiction books give us the opportunity to peer inside another person's mind. We get to see the results of interactions they have with others. These characters often act in ways or in situations we wouldn’t experience ourselves. Their thoughts and feelings are often quite different from how we would react in that situation. Reading fiction helps you think about ways in which others might think differently from you.

The only way the author is able to convey these thoughts and feelings is to describe them using words. If you pick up on any of the vocabulary or wording, that could help you put your own thoughts and feelings into words.

Studies often use “narrative transportation theory” when discussing this. The term “high emotional transportation” means a stories where the reader imagines they are immersed in the world, empathizing with the characters more deeply. Some [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559433/) show that people who have recently read “high emotional transportation” books have greater empathy than those who read something without high emotional transportation.

Try reading some fiction! You don’t need to read from a high school English class curriculum; popular fiction totally counts. The last book series I got totally immersed in was The Hunger Games. If you need an idea, maybe start with something from the top 10 bestsellers list for this year. You probably even know a person or two who has read one of those, and you can bond over that.
Meditation

Some people describe meditation as the art of sitting with your thoughts and feelings, not judging them or holding on to them too strongly. Practicing meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions. Unlike many of the other techniques here, meditation isn’t a great time to actively think about and process these automatic feelings - but it is useful for helping you become aware of them.

Rumination is a risk with meditation just as it is with journaling, and perhaps even more so. Sitting with these normally-unseen thoughts and feelings can be stressful in the first place. It's also easy to judge these and accidentally kick off a downward spiral, making yourself feel worse.

The risk of becoming stressed from meditating is especially high for beginners. With practice, you will get better at not judging your thoughts and feelings. This sort of stress sometimes happens to experts too, although less often. Stress is more likely to happen when in a particularly challenging situation, or when mentally (or bodily) fatigued.

If you'd like to try getting into meditation, there are a lot of resources to help you get started in a gentle and gradual way. My favorite introduction to meditation lately is a mobile app "Headspace". It introduces meditation concepts one at a time, using voice guidance and cute little videos and animations. I learned a lot from the intro series on Headspace (10 sessions), which were free when I did it at least.
