## Experience Processing
In this section you will learn specific techniques to help you fully process experiences, putting them to words. In the following section you will learn many of the common pitfalls or "bugs" people encounter when processing these experiences, and ways of "bugfixing" them.

Verbalizing and investigating experiences can help you in so many ways. It can help reduce the stress you feel about a given situation. It can help you feel more in control and at ease. It can help you express your experiences to others. It can help you choose the best response for the situation. You also get the opportunity influence your future thoughts and feelings, through deliberate thought.

Our ability to enunciate our experiences to ourselves and to others is extremely powerful. Words give experiences "handles" that we can use to inspect them, manipulate them, and figure out what's really going on.  We can process experiences a lot more deeply and effectively by using accurate language than we can by using abstract wordless thoughts alone. You might verbalize an experience in several different settings, and each will have a similar effect. Just to name a few, you might verbalize an experience when think to yourself, or talk to a friend, or write something to an imagined-person.

We'll cover seven concrete techniques to help you better process experiences. Four of them involve processing your own experiences. Three others involve processing others' experiences, which helps you with the skills involved for processing your own as well. All of these have an overarching theme: "accept automatic thoughts and automatic emotions as inputs".

In the moment where you experience an emotion, it is already outside of your control and influence. In the system we described earlier (input, process, output), "you" are your conscious mind, and these "automatic emotions" are an input to your system. If you can accept these automatic emotions as data, that will significantly help you process them.

It can take a lot of practice and training to accept emotions as input. It will get easier with time and repetition. If you want to practice this deliberately, you might consider a meditation practice. Many meditation practices actively focus on observing thoughts and emotions non-judgmentally.

## Processing Your Own Experiences
### Talk with a friend

One of the most powerful techniques for processing an experience is to talk with a close friend. This is also my personal favorite. Not only is it helpful for processing the experience, but it is also a bonding opportunity for the relationship.

Talking through an issue with a friend helps you more fully understand an experience by getting you to put it all into concrete words. If your actively listening friend can accurately reflect back to you what you're saying, that helps solidify the thoughts, helping your process it even further. Sometimes a friend will describe something in a different way than you, you may end up adopting some of their phrasing. When you have trouble putting certain ideas into words, a friend can help you explore those. They might brainstorm different ways of describing it until something feels accurate and correct.

Here's an example of me talking with a friend. I start by asking the friend if they can help talk me through something, so they're ready for my unprocessed thoughts. Sometimes I end up rambling a bit, trying to figure out the right word, and my friend will offer help. For example, I might try: "I feel good about it. Excited maybe? Not quite excited. I do think it’ll go my way, and that’s a comforting feeling."  My actively listening friend might suggest "are you feeling confident?" and in this case, they're correct! Or if not, we'll continue on until a description feels right.

Often you can find a single word for something. If not, you can at least find a phrase or sentence-long explanation of the feeling. Once you and your friend have a shared understanding, that really validates the experience. This shared understanding can help you feel like the emotion has been processed, and it can feel like a huge relief.

Talking with a friend can help you put an experience into words, and it can also help you feel better while doing so, too. Putting the experience into words can be a huge relief, especially when the experience is complex or troublesome. If they reflect back to you accurately, that can make you feel understood by another person, and that can be very comforting. Being vulnerable is also a powerful way to deepen the relationship.

Talking with a friend is often the most powerful method of processing an experience. However, talking with an unsupportive friend could make you feel worse. The friend might inadvertently invalidate your experiences, making you feel more uncertain and shut-down. Later in this book there is an entire chapter dedicated to communicating in a validating way. Learning these validation skills can help you support your friends. Your modeling of effective validation and support might even help your friends learn how to support you in a helpful way.

### Rubber duck
Don't have a friend around? Try talking to a rubber duck!

The "rubber duck debugging" technique is a common trick among software developers. You can gain a lot of insight into the problem by attempting to explain the situation to a rubber duck on your desk. Imagine the duck is sentient, and have a full conversation with it in your head. Especially imagine what questions it would ask, and what information it would need to know to be able to help. You can imagine the duck has the same context a coworker would have, or no context at all. You can end up with a lot of the benefit you would get from talking with another person, without taking up their time.

Talking with the duck helps you notice assumptions you're making and enunciate them. Often the root of the issue can be found within these assumptions.

You can always fall back to actually asking the coworker or friend for help, and at that point you'll be able to explain the situation more accurately, clearly, and succinctly given the processing you already did.

Talking to a duck can "pre-process" your thoughts - partially process them before having a friend help you process them the rest of the way.

Before I talk with a coworker, I try and think of what questions they would ask me to get enough context on the issue to be able to help. Before I take up their time, I'll often try to predict what questions they would ask, and what assumptions they would need to know about. Often just by thinking through these I end up discovering exactly what I needed to know to figure out the situation, and I don't even end up needing to talk with them! Even though I use this technique so often, I'm still so surprised every time it helps. It really does.

Rubber duck debugging is often a tool used in work environments, but you can apply the same idea to personal experiences too. You can change the imagined-audience to be your best friend, a family member, or someone else as appropriate to the situation. And if you can't think of an existing person who would be particularly appropriate, you can even imagine up someone new.

### Journaling
Talking with someone (real or imagined) is a poweful technique, but sometimes an issue requires even more. Writing can help you go even deeper on an issue. Writing encourages you to use only the most accurate terms. Writing also enables you to go back and edit things until it feels correct. When re-reading what you've written you can often tell what feels right and what feels off.

Journaling is the third tool in your toolbelt. You can journal to yourself, future-you, past-you, or even to the journal itself. In some ways it's like writing the rubber duck we described earlier.

You don't need a physical journal to practice "journaling". Some people prefer physical journals, but others like to journal using a computer. My favorite place to journal is in an email draft message. It is quick to load, and doesn't have any frills to get in the way.

EMAIL

Often I'll start an email draft by addressing it to myself, but imagining I would send it to a coworker.

[EMAIL TECHNIQUE?]

You can do this all out loud (if you dare), quietly in your head, or even in writing. I accidentally use this technique a lot. Often I'll start an email draft or instant message to a coworker explaining the situation and asking for their input, and then I end up not needing to send it at all!

You can use the rubber duck when you have a specific issue to process.
Journaling I mean WRITING and also DOING IT REGULARLY



You can also talk with yourself. Writing is more effective than thinking alone - it activates a different part of the brain, and makes you really nail down thoughts and feelings.

Sometimes I imagine writing to future-Casey or past-Casey. Sometimes I imagine writing a friend, like I mentioned above. I write out all my thoughts and all my emotions in stream of consciousness, putting it all to words. I try to use really specific emotional words so I can really deeply understand it. I also try and identify maladaptive thought patterns, which we’ll cover in the next section.

My biggest tip is to make it easy for yourself to journal. Many people keep a paper journal handy at home. My favorite way is journaling into a gmail draft message. Somehow that loads faster than Google Docs or Microsoft Word, and it also feels more temporary.

Every time I journal I feel surprised how much it helps. You might imagine that thinking to yourself is similar, but somehow writing is a very different experience. When writing, you can pin more things down, and get a lot deeper and farther along with processing.

There is a major risk with journaling, and that’s rumination. Rumination is when you focus on the causes and consequences of something, instead of solutions. If you are too fixated on the negative, it can cause a downward spiral and make you feel even worse. Ideally you will develop techniques to be able to journal more effectively. Accepting inputs as things you cannot change, and identifying maladaptive thought patterns like we’ll do in the next section. You could accidentally reinforce maladaptive thought patterns if you’re not careful, or if you’re not in the right mindset to deal with them. If that’s the case, you may want to try another technique, or try again later.


### Meditation

Some people describe meditation as the art of sitting with your thoughts and feelings, not judging them or holding on to them too strongly. Practicing meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions. Unlike many of the other techniques here, meditation isn’t a great time to actively think about and process these automatic feelings - but it is useful for helping you become aware of them.

Rumination is a risk with meditation just as it is with journaling, and perhaps even more so. Sitting with these normally-unseen thoughts and feelings can be stressful in the first place. It's also easy to judge these and accidentally kick off a downward spiral, making yourself feel worse.

The risk of becoming stressed from meditating is especially high for beginners. With practice, you will get better at not judging your thoughts and feelings. This sort of stress sometimes happens to experts too, although less often. Stress is more likely to happen when in a particularly challenging situation, or when mentally (or bodily) fatigued.

If you'd like to try getting into meditation, there are a lot of resources to help you get started in a gentle and gradual way. My favorite introduction to meditation lately is a mobile app "Headspace". It introduces meditation concepts one at a time, using voice guidance and cute little videos and animations. I learned a lot from the intro series on Headspace (10 sessions), which were free when I did it at least.

## Processing Others' Experiences

### Reading fiction

Most people agree that reading nonfiction can be "useful". Nonfiction teaches us facts. People are more divided about how useful fiction is. Fiction may not teach as many facts, but it is often "useful" for social and emotional learning!

Fiction books give us the opportunity to peer inside another person's mind. We get to see the results of interactions they have with others. These characters often act in ways or in situations we wouldn’t experience ourselves. Their thoughts and feelings are often quite different from how we would react in that situation. Reading fiction helps you think about ways in which others might think differently from you.

The only way the author is able to convey these thoughts and feelings is to describe them using words. If you pick up on any of the vocabulary or wording, that could help you put your own thoughts and feelings into words.

Studies often use "narrative transportation theory" when discussing this. The term "high emotional transportation" means a stories where the reader imagines they are immersed in the world, empathizing with the characters more deeply. Some [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559433/) show that people who have recently read "high emotional transportation" books have greater empathy than those who read something without high emotional transportation.

Try reading some fiction! You don’t need to read from a high school English class curriculum; popular fiction totally counts. The last book series I got totally immersed in was The Hunger Games. If you need an idea, maybe start with something from the top 10 bestsellers list for this year. You probably even know a person or two who has read one of those, and you can bond over that.

### Emotional vocabulary
Expanding your emotional vocabulary can help deepen this effect a lot. Children are usually taught the most simple emotions first -- like happy, sad, angry, tired -- and later they learn how to describe more complex emotions. Generally people understand a huge number more words than they regularly use, and this applies to emotional vocabulary as well. With some practice, you can learn to use a much richer emotional vocabulary.

The more often you deliberately use more specific terms, the more often your mind will automatically use them as well. Nudging your automatic thoughts in this direction can substantially change the way you process experiences. The line between automatic and deliberate thoughts can feel blurry when you're working on this, and that's okay - it's a gradual process.

One tool you can use to expand your emotional vocabulary is a emotion thesaurus chart. Keep a reference like this one somewhere handy; print this one out, or save it to your desktop. There are many more resources like this online - some in circular graphs, some with more colors.

The next time you are trying to describe your emotions (whether to yourself or to someone else!), try out the reference. It might have just the right word to describe something, or it at least might help you get closer to the right word. If the chart doesn't help enough directly, you might try a traditional thesaurus, or ask a friend or two how they would describe it.

## Homework
* Print out the emotional vocabulary chart [from this article](https://hbr.org/2016/11/3-ways-to-better-understand-your-emotions), to have it handy next time you need it. If you can’t print it, make it accessible somehow: save it to your desktop or email it to yourself and star it.
  * (optional) look for others to print, too - there are a lot of these available.
* Try processing emotions a bit each day this week. Try a different tactic each day this week:
  * Schedule a time with a friend to talk about your feelings
  * Discuss a problem with a "rubber duck" for 10 minutes
  * Journal for 10 minutes once
  * Meditate (at least 3 sessions). Perhaps using the [Headspace app](https://www.headspace.com/) for guidance.
* Read more about the Six Levels of Validation
  * This [high-level overview article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pieces-mind/201204/understanding-validation-way-communicate-acceptance)
  * Or [this original source (download pdf)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232561580_Validation_and_psychotherapy) from "Validation and Psychotherapy" by Marsha Linehan, 1997.
* (optional) Choose a fiction book to read after this one. An audiobook counts, if you prefer.


#### Communicating Validation
If you want to help support others emotionally by listening, you should communicate validation yourself. My favorite tool for thinking about validating is Dr. Linehan’s "Six Levels of Validation". These are her six levels of validation, in order of increasing impact:

1. Be present
  - Just being present in the moment with your friend can be validating on its own. This could be active listening, or even as little as just being physically present if nobody is talking.
2. Accurate reflection
  - You might sometimes ask "how do you feel about ____?". Your friend will describe their thoughts and feelings. If you can communicate it back to them accurately, that can be very validating. Sometimes you may even describe it back in a way that inspires a change in the way they think about it. Be careful to leave plenty of room for them to correct you, or it could backfire and make them feel invalidated instead.
3. Guessing about unstated feelings
  - If your friend is not able to communicate something clearly or fully enough, you may be able to help them out. You can ask "are you feeling ____? or ____?" to help them refine the way they think about the situation. Doing this well is generally more validating than levels 1 or 2. Be careful though, because if they aren't comfortable correcting your guess this could backfire and make them feel invalidated.
4. Validate in terms of past history
  -  You can communicate to your friend that their current response makes sense, given their past. If a friend was bit by a large dog as a child, it makes sense that they might still be afraid of large dogs as an adult.
5. Validate in terms of present events and the way most people would react
  - You can communicate to your friend that their response makes sense given the situation. Talking through the details of the situation you might decide that anyone in this situation would have reacted in a similar way. If your friend is afraid of holding a snake, that is totally unsurprising - so many people are afraid of snakes.
6. Radical genuineness
  - READ LINEHAN AGAIN

I recommend reading more about this and trying this out. It’s not a strict scale of what you should use, but it’s a really helpful tool when considering how to respond to a friend who is being vulnerable with you. My favorite high-level overview of this is [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pieces-mind/201204/understanding-validation-way-communicate-acceptance) by Karyn Hall. If you want a more thorough overview right from the source, you might consider reading [this chapter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232561580_Validation_and_psychotherapy) from "Validation and Psychotherapy" by Marsha Linehan, 1997.


#### Close Relationships
Hopefully you have several close friends you can readily talk to about your thoughts and feelings. Studies show that the more close connections you have, the healthier you are, the longer you live, and the more resilient you are in the face of stress. The list of positive benefits of social connectedness goes on and on.

There is a recent "loneliness epidemic" in the US. [source](https://www.cigna.com/newsroom/news-releases/2018/new-cigna-study-reveals-loneliness-at-epidemic-levels-in-america). You may feel like you have many (or any?) close friends you can have intimate discussions with. If so, consider making it a priority to have more, deeper relationships. This can be difficult, but it is well worth the effort.

Ideally your emotionally supportive relationships are reciprocal. You should also offer to talk friends through issues they’re having as well. Assuming this discussion all goes well, being vulnerable like this with each other can dramatically improve your relationship. It can deepen feelings of trust with each other.

My favorite technique for making your friends supportive is to communicate validation and acceptance explicitly. There will be an entire section about this later.

#### Too Much?

Sharing your emotions with others is often really good for you, and it can bring you closer together. There is an extreme though, which could be a problem. It is possible to impose too much, expecting your friend to do "emotional labor" for you in a way that they could resent. If the support is one-way (they support you more than you support them), that makes it much more likely your friend would feel frustrated. If there’s an imbalance in how much each of you need in the first place, that could be an issue too. Prioritize communicating with your close friends about these concerns to set healthy boundaries.

A friend’s support can go a long way, but for deeper issues or trauma friends may not be enough. Therapists are trained to help with this. Think about whether this support is enough, or if a therapist might help more. If you haven’t tried therapy, you should seriously consider at least being screened.
