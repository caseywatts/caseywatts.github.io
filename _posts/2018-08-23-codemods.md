A codemod helps you make sweeping changes to your code in a really straightforward way. React and Ember both use codemods a ton to help make the upgrade path easy.

It's kinda like changing your code using a regular expression, except way better. Instead of manipulating strings, it's based on manipulating the Abstract Syntax Tree. To see what an Abstract Syntax Tree (ast) is like, try putting some code into [ASTExplorer](https://astexplorer.net/) and see what it spits out!

Some technologies involved:

- `codemod` - language-agnostic tool to help run ast manipulations on a codebase / files
- `ast-types` - helps us work with an in-memory representation of the AST, using javascript
- `recast` - a library that helps read/write AST (using `ast-types`) from javascript source code (text)
- `jscodeshift` - a higher-level tool - it helps us use javascript to manipulate the AST (create/edit/delete "ast nodes")

To write a codemod I use `jscodeshift` directly, and it incorporates the rest. I've had to read documentation from them all, but I don't have to import anything specifically from the others.

## My Codemod

I made my first codemod this week! It helps ember users migrate away from importing `faker` that's bundled in `ember-cli-mirage` to instead import it from `faker` directly. I'm so glad we don't have to edit these 200 files manually. This also helps out the whole Ember community, for when `ember-cli-mirage` eventually moves away from having it bundled at all.

## Getting Started

Here are some helpful references & resources I used to learn how codemods work, and create the one I did.

1. Intro Articles
  - Intro to start making a codemod for a js library, and many tips for how to use the [AST explorer tool](https://astexplorer.net/): https://vramana.github.io/blog/2015/12/21/codemod-tutorial/
  - This is the original article that explains the structure of jscodeshift and how it was designed https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb
2. Documentation
  - jscodeshift documentation is in the [source files](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/tree/master/src) or you can view them as jsdocs (see [my pull request](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/pull/272) for how)
  - AST type function signatures are documented in the [ast-types](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types) repo (the `def` folder).
  - The [`recast` documentation](https://github.com/benjamn/recast) goes through `path` vs `node` pretty well
3. Development Tips
  - Test setup documentation in the [jscodeshift repo](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift#unit-testing)
  - To automate test setup (and for npx setup), try [codemod-cli](https://github.com/rwjblue/codemod-cli)
  - For sharing your codemod, there are many options, from `npx` to running it with githubusercontent. See [my gist about the options](https://gist.github.com/caseywatts/b8fffb51180fe44cd3706407d61150a3)
