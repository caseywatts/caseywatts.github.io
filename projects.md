## Projects

### Folk Tune Transposer
<https://caseywatts.com/folktunetransposer>

A ton folk music is written for instruments in the key of C, like fiddles and pianos.  So many instruments are in other keys - like Clarinet and Trumpet are in the key of Bb, and French Horn is in the key of F. This tool I made makes it possible to transpose folk tunes on the fly to be playable by non-C instruments. It reads in music via "ABC" notation, which you can find on folk tune sites like <http://www.folktunefinder.com>.


### DC Metro Map
<https://caseywatts.com/dcmetromap>

This "mobile app" keeps a copy of DC's Metro Map offline for you to use while you're underground without internet access. It's not an app store app, but it looks like one. You do "add to home screen", and it's available as an app icon and it works offline! It's using technology that makes it a "Progressive Web Application".

### CardSwipr
<http://github.com/YaleSTC/cardswipr>

Keeps track of who has attended an event, using their Yale ID card to swipe in. A small, simple application in Ruby on Rails. Interviewed every group on campus that had a similar system to see how this app might meet their needs. Worked with central ITS to expose [card-swipe ⇔ identity] as a web API.

### YaleLDAP Gem
<http://github.com/YaleSTC/yaleldap>

Greatly simplifies connection to Yale’s LDAP Server. Well documented, 4.0 on Code Climate.

### Reservations
<http://yalestc.github.io/reservations>

Manages the loaning and reservation of equipment items. Used by ~14 groups on campus to manage 10,000’s reservations of 100’s of equipment items. A large, stable, well-tested application in Ruby on Rails.

### Shifts
<http://yalestc.github.io/shifts>

Coordinates where and when employees work. Employees sign themselves up, swap shifts, are held accountable. Manages payment. Used by ~7 groups to manage ~400 employees. A large, difficult legacy application. Going through massive Rails 2 => Rails 3 upgrade.

### Service Now Tweaks Browser Extension
<http://github.com/YaleSTC/Service-Now-Tweaks>

Improves the experience of Service Now, is an IT ticket tracking software with an otherwise terrible interface.

### Yale Wiki, Haven Free Clinic Wiki, Student Technology Collaborative Wiki
<http://yalewiki.org> (retired)

Helps people share information and collaborate, especially long-term. Editable by anyone affiliated with the group. For YaleWiki.org, &gt;50,000 views/year by a population of &lt;5,000. Information architecture, server administration, MediaWiki with custom plugins.
