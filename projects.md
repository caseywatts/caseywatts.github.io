## Big Projects

### CardSwipr  
<http://github.com/YaleSTC/cardswipr>

Keeps track of who has attended an event, using their Yale ID card to swipe in. A small, simple application in Ruby on Rails. Interviewed every group on campus that had a similar system to see how this app might meet their needs. Worked with central ITS to expose [card-swipe ⇔ identity] as a web API.

### YaleLDAP Gem
<http://github.com/YaleSTC/yaleldap>

Greatly simplifies connection to Yale’s LDAP Server. Well documented, 4.0 on Code Climate.

### Reservations
<http://yalestc.github.io/reservations>

Manages the loaning and reservation of equipment items. Used by ~14 groups on campus to manage 10,000’s reservations of 100’s of equipment items. A large, stable, well-tested application in Ruby on Rails.

### Shifts
<http://yalestc.github.io/shifts>

Coordinates where and when employees work. Employees sign themselves up, swap shifts, are held accountable. Manages payment. Used by ~7 groups to manage ~400 employees. A large, difficult legacy application. Going through massive Rails 2 => Rails 3 upgrade.

### Service Now Tweaks Browser Extension

Improves the experience of Service Now, is an IT ticket tracking software with an otherwise terrible interface.
