<div class="prose">
  <p>Employees need support to thrive. In modern tech, managers are expected to actively support their employees as professionals. Sometimes this works out and you have a great people-manager who supports your growth and cares about your happiness. This doesn't always happen, but when it does it works out great for the employees at least!</p>
  <p>Who supports people at the top? Who can a CTO talk to about CTO problems? When a CTO is too busy to be an active mentor (it's common!), who can support technical leaders like engineering managers and product managers?</p>
  <p>Ignore this situation and everyone loses out: you lose out as an individual, your company loses out by not having you stay and grow, your customer lose out by having less effective, engaged employees. Conversely, doing a great job at this has huge benefits: employee happiness, effectiveness, retention, easier hiring, and happier customers. It's a shame any company misses out on these!</p>

<h2>How?</h2>
There are generally three approaches to getting one-on-one support as a professional: internal coaching, external coaching, and personal coaching.

<h2>Approach</h2>
<h3>Goal Setting & Tracking</h3>
<p>Together, we create goals and track them. We define these at beginning of the coaching relationship, and update them periodically. These help focus our efforts, making sure the coachee gets the most out of the relationship. Sometimes externally-set goals are a part of the process, but to be successful goals must be defined and agreed to by the coachee.</p>
<h3>Weekly One-on-ones</h3>
<p>The bulk of coaching progress is made in weekly 60-minute one-on-one conversations. We talk through areas for professional growth, and strategize how the coachee can approach that growth. In these, we talk through current challenges and potential approaches to dealing with them. The process of talking through a problem with someone who really gets it is hard to overstate.</p>
<h3>Engagement Duration</h3>
<p>Engagements are done for 3 months at a time, which is 12 coaching sessions per coachee.</p>
