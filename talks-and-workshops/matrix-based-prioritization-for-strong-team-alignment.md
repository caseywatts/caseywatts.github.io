Introduction to Matrix-Based Prioritization for Strong Organizational Alignment  
  
Technical leaders may consider joining us for lunch (12:30 pm to 1:30 pm EST) on Thursday, March 25th when Casey Watts will deliver a presentation entitled Matrix-Based Prioritization for Strong Organizational Alignment.  
  
As a team, how do we decide what to do first? You may have used or seen the good ol' 2x2 matrix for prioritizing things in the past. The most common ones are "impact vs urgency" and "business goals vs user goals". The 2x2 matrix is a visual tool to help us determine and discuss priorities.  
  
But for some decisions, two dimensions are not enough to get the team aligned. Without alignment, a project team experiences churn, conflict, and "bikeshedding". We all deserve confidence and pride in what we're working on, and why. Fortunately, teams can totally get aligned when we embrace the real-world complexity of decision-making.  
  
Introduction to prioritization matrices for discovering better decision-making criteria  
  
In this workshop, we will complete several prioritization matrices of increasing complexity: building up from the simple 2x2 matrix to a 3+ variable matrix, all the way to a weighted 3+ variable matrix. After this workshop, you will have the tools to visually discuss a whole range of complexities with these tools. Some questions we answer include:  
  
When to use which tool?  
How to determine decision-making criteria?  
Stronger organizational alignment yields better outcomes  
  
This workshop is helpful for people who prioritize what gets done at a company: organization leadership, product managers, and engineers. Respectively: which projects to prioritize staffing, what features research and implementation to prioritize, and which technical debt/engineering backlog issues to prioritize.  
  
With strong team alignment, we'll go farther, faster!  
  
About Casey Watts  
  
Casey Watts is an independent consultant based in the Washington, DC area. Casey attended Yale University and earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology with a focus on the Neuroscience Track.  
  
Casey recently published a book recently entitled Debugging Your Brain -- from the book:  
  
"The human brain is buggy. Sometimes your mind distorts reality, gets frustrated with shortcomings, and spirals out of control. With practice, you can debug your brain. Catch those distortions of reality, transform those frustrations into insight, and short-circuit those downward spirals.  
  
Debugging Your Brain (DYB) is a clear applied psychology book and a concise self-help book. Whether or not you have a technical background, you will find the software development analogies approachable and insightful. You will likely reference and re-read DYB many times, each time discovering new insights.  
  
DYB is full of practical techniques. Each technique is condensed to its core idea, accompanied by just enough story to make it memorable. Each chapter has activities to help you put its techniques into practice. The chapters include: Modeling The Brain, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Introspection, Identifying Inputs, Experience Processing, Experience Validation, and Cognitive Restructuring.  
  
Your brain is a complex system. Patch the software that runs in your mind."
