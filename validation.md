#### Communicating Validation
If you want to help support others emotionally by listening, you should communicate validation yourself. My favorite tool for thinking about validating is Dr. Linehan’s "Six Levels of Validation". These are her six levels of validation, in order of increasing impact:

1. Be present
  - Just being present in the moment with your friend can be validating on its own. This could be active listening, or even as little as just being physically present if nobody is talking.
2. Accurate reflection
  - You might sometimes ask "how do you feel about ____?". Your friend will describe their thoughts and feelings. If you can communicate it back to them accurately, that can be very validating. Sometimes you may even describe it back in a way that inspires a change in the way they think about it. Be careful to leave plenty of room for them to correct you, or it could backfire and make them feel invalidated instead.
3. Guessing about unstated feelings
  - If your friend is not able to communicate something clearly or fully enough, you may be able to help them out. You can ask "are you feeling ____? or ____?" to help them refine the way they think about the situation. Doing this well is generally more validating than levels 1 or 2. Be careful though, because if they aren't comfortable correcting your guess this could backfire and make them feel invalidated.
4. Validate in terms of past history
  -  You can communicate to your friend that their current response makes sense, given their past. If a friend was bit by a large dog as a child, it makes sense that they might still be afraid of large dogs as an adult.
5. Validate in terms of present events and the way most people would react
  - You can communicate to your friend that their response makes sense given the situation. Talking through the details of the situation you might decide that anyone in this situation would have reacted in a similar way. If your friend is afraid of holding a snake, that is totally unsurprising - so many people are afraid of snakes.
6. Radical genuineness

I recommend reading more about this and trying this out. It’s not a strict scale of what you should use, but it’s a really helpful tool when considering how to respond to a friend who is being vulnerable with you. My favorite high-level overview of this is [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/pieces-mind/201204/understanding-validation-way-communicate-acceptance) by Karyn Hall. If you want a more thorough overview right from the source, you might consider reading [this chapter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232561580_Validation_and_psychotherapy) from "Validation and Psychotherapy" by Marsha Linehan, 1997.


#### Close Relationships
Hopefully you have several close friends you can readily talk to about your thoughts and feelings. Studies show that the more close connections you have, the healthier you are, the longer you live, and the more resilient you are in the face of stress. The list of positive benefits of social connectedness goes on and on.

There is a recent "loneliness epidemic" in the US. [source](https://www.cigna.com/newsroom/news-releases/2018/new-cigna-study-reveals-loneliness-at-epidemic-levels-in-america). You may feel like you have many (or any?) close friends you can have intimate discussions with. If so, consider making it a priority to have more, deeper relationships. This can be difficult, but it is well worth the effort.

Ideally your emotionally supportive relationships are reciprocal. You should also offer to talk friends through issues they’re having as well. Assuming this discussion all goes well, being vulnerable like this with each other can dramatically improve your relationship. It can deepen feelings of trust with each other.

My favorite technique for making your friends supportive is to communicate validation and acceptance explicitly. There will be an entire section about this later.

#### Too Much?

Sharing your emotions with others is often really good for you, and it can bring you closer together. There is an extreme though, which could be a problem. It is possible to impose too much, expecting your friend to do "emotional labor" for you in a way that they could resent. If the support is one-way (they support you more than you support them), that makes it much more likely your friend would feel frustrated. If there’s an imbalance in how much each of you need in the first place, that could be an issue too. Prioritize communicating with your close friends about these concerns to set healthy boundaries.

A friend’s support can go a long way, but for deeper issues or trauma friends may not be enough. Therapists are trained to help with this. Think about whether this support is enough, or if a therapist might help more. If you haven’t tried therapy, you should seriously consider at least being screened.
